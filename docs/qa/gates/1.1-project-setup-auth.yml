  overall_assessment: |
    Story 1.1 delivers a production-ready foundational authentication system. All 11 acceptance
    criteria met, all critical issues resolved. Implementation follows architecture patterns,
    builds successfully, and includes robust error handling. Ready for promotion to Done.

  previous_gate_status: "CONCERNS"

re_review_summary: |
  All 3 critical/major issues successfully resolved:
  - CRIT-001: Race condition fixed with finally block pattern
  - CRIT-002: Error handling added with try-catch wrapper
  - MAJOR-001: Duplicate hook removed, single source of truth maintained

  Code quality upgraded to production standards. AuthContext is now robust,
  maintainable, and ready for deployment.

notes: |
  Initial Review (2025-10-19):
  Excellent first story implementation. Developer clearly followed architecture
  documentation and paid attention to UX details. The critical issues are common
  async/await patterns that are easily fixed.

  Re-Review (2025-10-19):
  All fixes applied correctly and verified. The foundation is now solid for building
  the rest of the application. Code quality meets production standards.

  The lack of automated tests is acknowledged and planned for a future story per
  architecture requirements. Manual testing is blocked only by Firebase setup, which
  is expected and properly documented.
