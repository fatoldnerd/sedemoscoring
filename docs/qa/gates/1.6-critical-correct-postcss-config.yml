# QA Gate Summary

## Final Decision: âœ… APPROVED FOR DEPLOYMENT

This P0-BLOCKING bug fix has been thoroughly verified and meets all acceptance criteria. The root cause (incomplete PostCSS configuration) has been correctly resolved with the addition of the autoprefixer plugin to work alongside @tailwindcss/postcss.

All visual styling is now functional, and the application is ready for production deployment.
