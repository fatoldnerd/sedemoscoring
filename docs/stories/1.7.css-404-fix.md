# Story 1.7: PO OVERRIDE - Manually Fix CSS 404 Error

## Status
**Done**

## Story
**As a** user,
**I want** the application's CSS file to load without 404 errors,
**so that** the Tailwind styles are applied and the application displays correctly in the browser.

## Context
Story 1.6 was marked as complete by both Developer and QA agents, but this was a **false positive**. Manual browser testing reveals the application is still displaying as a plain, unstyled white page.

**Root Cause Discovery:** Browser DevTools Network tab shows the CSS file is returning a **404 (Not Found)** error. The `postcss.config.js` file has been corrected in Story 1.6, but a new bug has emerged: the Vite development server is not serving the compiled CSS file at the expected path.

**Priority:** CRITICAL - This is a blocking bug that prevents any visual confirmation of Tailwind CSS integration.

## PO Override Resolution
**Product Owner manually fixed the CSS 404 error.** The issue was that incompetent AI developer agents repeatedly failed to diagnose and resolve the root cause despite multiple attempts. The Product Owner intervened directly to unblock project progress.

## Acceptance Criteria
1. The CSS file must load with a **200 OK** status in the browser's Network tab (not 404)
2. Tailwind styles must be visibly applied to the page (confirmed by human review)
3. The file path in `index.html` must match the actual CSS file being served by Vite
4. The Vite configuration must correctly serve CSS assets during development

## Tasks / Subtasks

- [ ] **Task 1: Investigate File Path Configuration** (AC: 1, 3)
  - [ ] Output the **full contents** of `index.html` to examine the exact `<link>` tag path for the CSS file
  - [ ] Document the CSS file path referenced in the HTML

- [ ] **Task 2: Investigate Vite Configuration** (AC: 1, 4)
  - [ ] Output the **full contents** of `vite.config.js` to check for:
    - `base` path misconfigurations
    - `build.outDir` misconfigurations
    - CSS handling settings
  - [ ] Document any suspicious configuration values

- [ ] **Task 3: Verify Build Output** (AC: 1, 3)
  - [ ] Run `npm run build` to generate production assets
  - [ ] Run `ls -l dist/assets/` to list the actual generated filenames in the build directory
  - [ ] Compare the generated filenames with the paths referenced in `index.html`
  - [ ] Document the filename mismatch (if any)

- [ ] **Task 4: Diagnose and Fix 404 Error** (AC: 1, 3, 4)
  - [ ] Based on the outputs from Tasks 1-3, state a **new hypothesis** for the 404 error
  - [ ] Apply the fix to resolve the file path mismatch or configuration issue
  - [ ] Document the specific change made and the reasoning

- [ ] **Task 5: Verify Fix in Browser** (AC: 1, 2)
  - [ ] Start the Vite dev server
  - [ ] Check the browser's DevTools Network tab to confirm CSS file loads with **200 OK** status
  - [ ] Confirm Tailwind styles are visibly applied (DO NOT mark Done until human confirms this)

## Dev Notes

### Critical Context from Story 1.6
- The `postcss.config.js` file has been **fixed** and now correctly exports a configuration object
- Despite this fix, the CSS file is **still not loading** in the browser
- This indicates a **new, separate issue** related to file paths or Vite server configuration

### Investigation Focus
The developer must systematically investigate:
1. **What path is the HTML file requesting?** (check `index.html`)
2. **What path is Vite configured to serve?** (check `vite.config.js`)
3. **What files are actually being generated?** (check build output)

### File Path Debugging Strategy
- The 404 error means the browser is requesting a file that doesn't exist at that path
- Possible causes:
  - Incorrect `<link href="">` path in `index.html`
  - Vite `base` path configuration mismatch
  - CSS file not being generated due to misconfiguration
  - Import statement issue in the entry point file

### Testing
**Manual Browser Testing Required:**
- This story is **NOT Done** until the CSS file loads with a **200 OK** status in the browser's Network tab
- The human user must **personally confirm** that Tailwind styles are visible on the page
- Do not rely solely on command-line output or automated checks
